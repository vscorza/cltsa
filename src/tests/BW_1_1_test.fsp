/******************************************************************************

An engineering company evaluates projects in order to decide which ones to
bid for. For this a document describing the project needs to be accepted by
the company's engineering teams. If all the teams accept it, the document is
approved. It is discarded if all teams reject it.

There is a need for a workflow that can cope with the requests. We synthesize
a controller that acts as an enforcer for an emerging workflow that guarantees:
  a- A document can be reassigned to a team that has rejected it.
  b- A document cannot be reassigned to a team that has already accepted it.
  c- Only when a team rejects it after (all possible) re-evaluation can the
     document be rejected without consensus.

The case study can be scale in two directions:
1- Teams: The number of engineering teams.
2- Steps: The (maximum) number of evaluation steps a team can perform.
