\begin{definition}
	\actionLabel{def:CLTS} \emph{(Concurrent Labelled Transition Systems)} 
	A \emph{Concurrent Labelled Transition System} (CLTS) is defined as 
	\cltsDef, 
	where $S$ is a finite set of states, $\Sigma$ is its {\em set of actions}, $\Delta \subseteq (S \times 2^{|\Sigma|} \times S)$ is a transition relation, $s_0 \in S$ is the initial state,
	 $\propositions : \{\proposition_0,\ldots,\proposition_k\}$ is a finite set of atomic 
	 propositions and $\valuations : S \mapsto  2^{|\propositions|}$ is the function that defines the set of propositions that hold at a given state $s \in S$.  
	%We denote $\Delta(s)=\{\actionLabel~|~(s,\actionLabel,s') \in \Delta\}$. 
	A CLTS is deterministic if $(s,\actionLabel,s')$ and $(s,\actionLabel,s'')$ are in $\Delta$ then $s'=s''$ should hold.
	An execution of $E$ is a word \executionDef where $(s_i, \actionLabel_i, s_{i+1}) \in \Delta$. 
	%A word $\pi$ is a trace (induced by $\varepsilon$) of $E$ if its the result of removing every $s_i$ from an execution $\varepsilon$ of $E$. 	We denote the set of infinite traces of $E$ by $\traces(E)$. 
	Given a transition $(s_i, \actionLabel, s_j) \in \Delta$, we will call $\actionLabel$ its label, and each element $\action \in \actionLabel$ an action.
