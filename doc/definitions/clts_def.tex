\begin{definition}
	\label{def:CLTS} \emph{(Concurrent Labelled Transition Systems)} 
	A \emph{Concurrent Labelled Transition System} (CLTS) is \cltsDef, where $S$ is a finite set of states, $\Sigma \subseteq Act$ is its {\em communicating alphabet}, $\Delta \subseteq (S \times 2^{|S|} \times S)$ is a transition relation, $s_0 \in S$ is the initial state, and $\acceptors \in \acceptingSymbols\mapsto 2^{|S|}$ is the set of sets of accepting states identified by a unique symbol in $\acceptingSymbols$.  We denote $\Delta(s)=\{\act~|~(s,\act,s') \in \Delta\}$ and $\acceptors(\acceptingSymbol)=\{\acceptingSet \in 2^{|S|}~|~\acceptingSymbol\mapsto\acceptingSet \in \acceptors\}$. 
	An CLTS is deterministic if $(s,\act,s')$ and $(s,\act,s'')$ are in $\Delta$ implies $s'=s''$.
	An execution of $E$ is a word \executionDef where $(s_i, \act_i, s_{i+1}) \in \Delta$. 
	A word $\pi$ is a trace (induced by $\varepsilon$) of $E$ if its the result of removing every $s_i$ from an execution $\varepsilon$ of $E$. 
	We denote the set of infinite traces of $E$ by $\traces(E)$.
