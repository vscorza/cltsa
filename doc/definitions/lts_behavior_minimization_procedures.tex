The strategy to find a minimal non realizable control problem is to incrementally remove transitions preserving an alternating Sub-LTS relation until a local minimum is reached.  A minimal non realizable control problem is reached when any further reduction of the current Sub-LTS renders the problem realizable.
The first procedure explores the semi-lattice defined by Alternating Sub-LTS relation starting with the original automaton and moving downwards by performing minimal reductions.

Consider the example of Figure~\ref{fig:fig.several-conflicts} where the system has to satisfy the liveness goal of
achieving $g$ infinitely often (expressed
by the LTL formula $\square \Diamond g$)
with $\Sigma = \{u_1, u_2, u_3, c_1, c_2, g\}$ and 
$\mathcal{C} = \{c_1, c_2, g\}$, the original LTS $E$ will be
at the top of the semi lattice while $E_1$ (depicted in figure \ref{fig:fig.several-conflicts-min1}) and $E_2$ (depicted in 
figure \ref{fig:fig.several-conflicts-min2}) will be at 
the bottom.  In between there is, for example, the Alternating Sub-LTSs
obtained by removing just one non controllable transition.  
The automaton obtained by removing $\{u_1, u_3\}$ is not shown
since it is realizable. 

\begin{figure}[ht]

		\label{fig:dfs-code}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

We can now describe the algorithm as
presented in figure \ref{fig:dfs-code}. The algorithm first removes all controllable transitions from
mixed states A, this step can be performed since it
can be interpreted as the successive removals of controllable 
transitions with each satisfying the Alternating Sub-LTS definition 
and preserving non realizability because if it was non realizable
for the mixed state it will remain non realizable when the controllable transitions are removed since int the game built from
the automaton at each mixed state the environment
wins the race condition, always picking the next move when allowed.
The next step initializes the set of 
candidate transitions
for removal at B and the effective list
to be removed at each iteration \texttt{to\_remove} at
C.  The latter keeps track of the transitions
removed along our search down the space of
Alternating Sub-LTSs for $E$.  The exploration
will continue until the candidate set is empty.
At each cycle starting at D the set is updated E by 
removing those transitions that were already removed by the reduction
at F or because they would induce a deadlock 
($d_{out}(E', t.from) == 1$ checks if there is only one
outgoing transition in the state from which \textbf{t} originates).
The
reduction, at F, looks for the closest
Alternating Sub-LTS obtained after removing 
transitions in \texttt{to\_remove} from $E$.
Then it checks for realizability G.  If the control problem is non
realizable the candidate set and the last 
Alternating Sub-LTS $E'$ are updated (since further minimization is 
possible), otherwise a one step backtrack
is triggered by removing the transition under test from
the effective set \texttt{to\_remove} H.
This is actually the backtracking point where the algorithm
shifts the search sideways in the semi-lattice instead of downwards.
Once the candidate set has been completely explored
the last non realizability preserving LTS $E'$ is
returned as a minimal Alternating Sub-LTS
for $E$ and $\mathcal{C}$ I.
Notice that
in the step H the transition $t$ was removed
from the candidate set but was retained in $E'$.  What happens if
the transition could have been removed further down the semi lattice?  Removing $t$ from $E'$ and reducing the Alternating Sub-LTS 
$E_{new}$ accordingly would render the control problem realizable.  Suppose that
the search continued preserving $t$ and removing other candidates
$t_1, \ldots, t_n$ from $E'$ getting the Alternating Sub-LTS
$E_{1,\ldots,n}$ that still contains $t$ while preserving non realizability.
If we were to remove $t$ from $E_{1,\ldots,n}$ after reducing it
to the closest Alternating Sub-LTS we would get a new LTS
$E'_{new}$ that can be Alternating Sub-LTS for $E_{new}$, and from lemma
\ref{def:induction-preserves} it will render the control problem
realizable.  We showed this way that if we are looking for just one
conflict we can immediately remove the transition that yielded realizability 
from the candidate set without jeopardizing minimality.
%\input{optimizations}
The procedure is complete w.r.t to the problem statement because
if a solution for the problem exists (for the sake of simplicity
suppose that there is only one possible minimal alternating sub-LTS $E'$
satisfying unrealizability), then the algorithm will effectively, and progressively,
reduce it to $E'$, if the problem has multiple solutions the
algorithm will yield one of those.

The procedure is sound w.r.t to the problem statement since 
at every step it holds that $E' \sublts E$ so the alternating condition
is met.  The realizability check ensures that the output keeps the
control problem unrealizable, and the minimality is satisfied by
checking that every closest alternating sub-LTS is realizable at the
final iteration in conjunction with lemma  ~\ref{def:induction-preserves}.\\

We introduced two modifications to the algorithm
to improve the time taken to compute the minimization.
The first optimization transforms the candidate set $\mathcal{T}_u$
into a list and orders it according to the distance of its elements 
with respect to the initial state.  The idea is to try and cut
as aggressively as possible first and see if a big cut still
preserves the non realizability cause.  The second optimization
looks for non controllable strips within the  input automaton
$E$, that is, sequences of non controllable actions without branches.
For each of these sequences only one action is
added to $\mathcal{T}_u$ since, if removed from $E'$
when looking for a minimal sub LTS all the others have to be removed
as well to preserve alternation.

Lemma ~\ref{def:induction-preserves} shows that we can keep removing
elements from a set $\mathcal{T}_u$ of candidate non controllable
transitions, reducing $E$ to its closest Alternating Sub-LTS.
Once we can not,
while preserving non-realizability, remove
anything else we have reached an Alternating Sub-LTS that is also minimal.
This follows from the fact that
no closest Alternating Sub-LTS exists bellow it that preserves non realizability.
If all the closest Alternating Sub-LTSs in its neighborhood 
are realizable the current LTS is minimal.


\begin{lemma}\label{def:induction-preserves}(\emph{Alternating Sub-LTSs preserve realizability})
	Let $E$ be the LTS for the non realizable control problem
	$\mathcal{I}=<E,\mathcal{C}, \varphi>$, and $E_1$, $E_2$ two LTSs s.t. 
	$E_2 \sublts E_1 \sublts E$ and
	$\mathcal{I}_1=<E_1, \mathcal{C}, \varphi>$, $\mathcal{I}_2=<E_2, \mathcal{C}, \varphi>$, if $\mathcal{I}_1$ is realizable then $\mathcal{I}_2$ is also realizable.
\end{lemma}


The second procedure uses the Delta Debugging technique presented in ~\cite{DBLP:journals/tse/ZellerH02} to accelerate the search space exploration. Instead of reducing the automaton by applying an atomic reduction at a time Delta Debugging tries to achieve a minimal diagnosis by partitioning the problem $\Delta$ into $n$ uniform subsets ($\Delta = \bigcup_{i=1}^n \Delta_i $) and then it first checks its elements $\Delta_i$ for a non realizable smaller case, if none is found it proceeds by looking at the complement $\Delta \setminus \Delta_i$ of each element in the partition. If no smaller candidate was found it increases the granularity by updating $n$ as $max(2n,|\Delta|)$. This cycle is repeated until $n$ can not be further increased ($n \geq |\Delta|$). 
In our application of Delta Debugging the set $\Delta$ is the set of non controllable transitions in the original plant. Instead of descending regularly down the semi lattice, Delta Debugging tries to jump further down by removing a subset of transitions from the current candidate. We can briefly prove that the application of the technique is sound since Delta Debugging ensures 1-minimality, i.e. that removing any single element from the resulting minmization breaks non realizability which in conjunction with lemma ~\ref{def:induction-preserves} implies minimality.
