When having to compose concurrent systems we define three different semantics that can be applied pairwise. Synchronous semantic $A ||_s B$ (Figure~\ref{fig:synchronous_composition})captures the composition of two components that share a single synchronizing event (implicit), where all participants should be able to make progress concurrently. The main motivation being digital components sharing a single clock. 
Asynchronous semantic $A ||_a B$ (Figure~\ref{fig:asynchronous_composition}) captures the interleaving interpretation of concurrency as found in LTS systems.

A motivation for the synchronous composition can be found in the following example: a digital design consists of two 1 bit full adders working as separate units. Let $i \in \{1,2\}$ be the index of each adder and $a$ and $b$ the 1 bit entries to be added, $c\_in_i$ the incoming carry signal from another module, $s_i$ the output that represents the lower bit of the sum and $c_i$ the upper bit or carry out, then each 1 bit full adder can be modeled as a single state CLTS.  The FSP syntax would be the following:

	FULL_ADDER[i] = (<a[i],s[i]> -> FULL_ADDER[i] | <b[i],s[i]> -> FULL_ADDER[i] 
	| <c_in[i],s[i]> -> FULL_ADDER [i] | <a[i],b[i],c[i]> -> FULL_ADDER[i]
	| <a[i],c_in[i],c[i]> -> FULL_ADDER[i] | <b[i],c_in[i],c[i]> -> FULL_ADDER[i]
	| <a[i],b[i],c_in[i],s[i],c[i]> -> FULL_ADDER[i]| <> -> FULL_ADDER[i]).
\end{lstlisting}

Applying asynchronous composition over single element labeled CLTS models ($FULL\_ADDER[1]$ $\parallel_{a}$ $FULL\_ADDER[2]$), would not properly capture the concurrent occurrence of signals, since it will not allow $<a_1,s_1,a_2,s_2>$ to happen.  

On the other hand, suppose that we are modeling the interaction of three processes $P_1$, $P_2$ and $receiver$ through a common buffer, $P_1$ produces either $a$ or $c$ and
$P_2$ produces either $d$ or $e$. $receiver$ will output a $x$ for each $a$ and a $y$ for each $d$. The FSP syntax would be the following:

\renewcommand{\ttdefault}{pcr}
\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{lstlisting}[escapeinside={[*}{*]},basicstyle=\scriptsize\ttfamily,columns=flexible,mathescape=true,xleftmargin=3.0ex,keywordstyle=\textbf,morekeywords={if,while,do,else,fork,int,null, algorithm, is, input, output, return, for}]
	P_1 = (a->P_1 | c->P_1).
	P_2 = (d->P_2 | e->P_2).
	Receiver = (<a,x> -> Receiver | <d,y> -> Receiver | c -> Receiver | e -> Receiver).
	\end{lstlisting}
	%\caption{Game Structure to CLTS translation algorithm}
	\label{fig:receiver_fsp}

\end{figure}

Special attention is required when applying the parallel composition operator in order to recreate the system overall interaction. If synchronous semantic ($P_1\parallel_s P_2 \parallel_s receiver$) is to be applied then $receiver$ will not be able to synchronize with both $P_1$ and $P_2$ since at least one action on each component needs to be exercised. In this case, asynchronous composition ($P_1\parallel_a P_2 \parallel_a receiver$)will properly recreate the serialization of events coming from $P_1$ and $P_2$ through the buffer.

Composition semantics should be applied according the each domain, be aware that composition is not commutative if different semantics are applied for the same specification.

When taking fluents into consideration several valuations can be applied to the same state, because of this a mechanism needs to be defined to disambiguate which valuation is correct at any given step of a trace that follows the behavior of an automaton.
In the context of this work the approach is to extend the states of the automaton with its fluents' valuations. Starting with the initial state the automaton is updated applying the following mapping:

\[
eval(s_0) = {Initially_0,\ldots,Initially_k}\\
eval(v,l) = {update(l,i) | i \in 0\ldots k}
\]
\[
update(l,i)	=  \begin{cases}
\top & \text{if } \exists \alpha \in I_i: l \subseteq \alpha \\
\bot & \text{if } \exists \beta \in T_i: l \subseteq \beta \\
v_i & \text{if } \nexists \gamma \in I_i \cup T_i: l \subseteq \gamma \\
\end{cases}
\]
