If we go back to the
planar robot example to apply the translation presented in appendix
\ref{appendix:cp2gs} we get the requirements related to state 4
as depicted in table \ref{table:state-4-translation}.

\begin{center}
\begin{table}[h]
  \begin{tabular}{ l  c  l }
	Name & Type & Requirement \\
    \hline
    3-4 $enable_e$ & $\rho_e$ & $\square(s=3 \wedge get.GPS.location = 1 \rightarrow$\\
    &&$\Circle(((data.rcvd = 1 \wedge timeout = 0)$\\
    &&$\vee(data.rcvd=0 \wedge timeout = 1)$\\
    &&$\wedge sensor.disabled = 0$\\
    &&$\wedge sensor.enabled = 0)))$\\
    3-4 $enable_s$ & $\rho_s$ & $\square(s=3 \wedge get.GPS.location = 1 \rightarrow$\\
        &&$\Circle(get.GPS.location = 0 $\\
        &&$\wedge get.SLAM.location = 0$\\
        &&$\wedge update.direction = 0))$\\
    3-4 $update_s$ & $\rho_s$ & $\square(s=3 \wedge get.GPS.location = 1 \rightarrow$\\
        &&$\Circle(s = 4))$\\        
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Planar robot state 4 requirements}
  \label{table:state-4-translation}
 \end{table}
\end{center}

We can see that the choices taken for every run in our plant are
restricted by both the system and the environment.  This might not be
the usual way to write signal-based specifications but is the way event
based models are specified.  If we were to achieve behavior minimization
we would expect to change the specification when disabling the event $data.rcvd$
at state 4 (as depicted in table \ref{table:state-4-translation-updated}).

\begin{center}
\begin{table}[h]
  \begin{tabular}{ l  c  l }
	Name & Type & Requirement \\
    \hline
    \textbf{3-4 $enable_e$} & $\rho_e$ & $\square(s=3 \wedge get.GPS.location = 1 \rightarrow$\\
    &&$\Circle(data.rcvd=0 \wedge timeout = 1$\\
    &&$\wedge sensor.disabled = 0$\\
    &&$\wedge sensor.enabled = 0))$\\
    3-4 $enable_s$ & $\rho_s$ & $\square(s=3 \wedge get.GPS.location = 1 \rightarrow$\\
        &&$\Circle(get.GPS.location = 0 $\\
        &&$\wedge get.SLAM.location = 0$\\
        &&$\wedge update.direction = 0))$\\
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Planar robot state 4 updated requirements}
  \label{table:state-4-translation-updated}
 \end{table}
\end{center}

The requirements related to transitions (1, $sensor.enabled$, 2),
(2, $get.SLAM.location$, 5),(5, $update.direction$, 1)
and (4, $data.rcvd$, 5) were removed by our technique and 
the ones related to (3, $get.$$GPS.$ $location$, 4) were modified.
We have introduced changes to both sides of the specification and not only
by adding or removing requirements, rendering the Cimatti et al. characterization
orthogonal.\\
