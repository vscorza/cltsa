Proof for Theorem\ref{theorem:theo.preserves-non-realizability}

\textbf{HAY QUE REVER ESTA PORQUE CAMBIO LA DEFINICIâ€°ON DE SUBLTS}
\begin{proof}
By way of contradiction suppose that 
$P$ is Alternating Sub-LTS of $M$ and $\mathcal{C}$ and that there
exists a counter strategy in $G(\mathcal{I}_P)$ that loses
$G(\mathcal{I}_M)$.
 Let $\pi$ be a play 
$s_0 s_1 \ldots$ consistent under non controllability with
the counter strategy that wins in $G(\mathcal{I}_P)$ but loses in $G(\mathcal{I}_M)$. 
$\pi$ leading to a finite win in $G(\mathcal{I}_P)$ at $s_{\bot}$
(not a finite state in $M$) will be prevented by the
alternation requirement where 
$\forall s_P \in S_P: |\Delta_M(s_p)| > 0 \rightarrow |\Delta_P(s_p)| > 0$ 
(implying $\forall s_P\prime=(s_P,\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_k) \in S_{G_P}: |\Gamma^{\beta}_M(s_p\prime)| > 0 \rightarrow |\Gamma^{\beta}_P(s_p\prime)| > 0$ ).  
If the environment has an infinite
win in $G(\mathcal{I}_P)$ not feasible in $G(\mathcal{I}_M)$ and since $G(\mathcal{I}_P) \subseteq G(\mathcal{I}_M)$
it follows that the system was able to take the play
out of the domain of the counter strategy.  In order
to accomplish this a state $s_a$ must be reached in
$\pi = s_0  \ldots s_a  \ldots$ where the environment
can no longer play according to the counter strategy.
The offending move has to be performed by the system, since
the environment would otherwise play according to his
winning strategy.
If $s_a \in S_P$ and $s_a$ is controllable we know that
under alternation $\Gamma^{+}_P(s_a) = \Gamma^{+}_M(s_a)$, i.e., all controllable options are
preserved at $s_a$.  If this is the case the strategy should
hold since it wins in $P$ against every system choice for
the preserved states.  
If $s_a \in S_{G_M} \setminus S_{G_P}$ there should exist $s_b$ 
the last state before $s_a$ ($\pi = s_0 \ldots s_b \ldots s_a \ldots$)
where the play stepped out of $S_{G_P}$.  If $s_b$ is non controllable
it would keep playing according to the counter strategy, 
so we can assume that $s_b$ is controllable, but if this is
the case, again, since all the controllable options are
preserved in $G(\mathcal{I}_P)$ and the winning strategy holds, by definition,
against every system choice, the environment should be able
to keep playing accordingly, not stepping out of $G(\mathcal{I}_P)$.
