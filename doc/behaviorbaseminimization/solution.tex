\section{Behavior Minimization Procedures}\label{sect:solution}

The strategy to find a minimal unrealizable control problem is to incrementally remove transitions preserving an alternating Sub-LTS relation until a local minimum is reached.  A minimal unrealizable control problem is reached when any further reduction of the current Sub-LTS renders the problem realizable.
The first procedure explores the semi-lattice defined by Alternating Sub-LTS relation starting with the original automaton and moving downwards by performing minimal reductions.

Consider the example of Figure~\ref{fig:fig.several-conflicts} where the system has to satisfy the liveness goal of
achieving $g$ infinitely often (expressed
by the LTL formula $\square \Diamond g$)
with $\Sigma = \{u_1, u_2, u_3, c_1, c_2, g\}$ and 
$\mathcal{C} = \{c_1, c_2, g\}$, the original LTS $E$ will be
at the top of the semi lattice while $E_1$ (depicted in figure \ref{fig:fig.several-conflicts-min1}) and $E_2$ (depicted in 
figure \ref{fig:fig.several-conflicts-min2}) will be at 
the bottom.  In between there is, for example, the Alternating Sub-LTSs
obtained by removing just one non controllable transition.  
The automaton obtained by removing $\{u_1, u_3\}$ is not shown
since it is realizable.

%\begin{definition}\label{def:minimal-non realizability legal-plant}\emph{(Minimal Counter-Strategy Preserving Sub-LTS)}
%Given a control problem $\mathcal{I'}=<E', \mathcal{C}, \varphi>$
%where $E' = (S_{E'}, \Sigma, \Delta_{E'}, s_0)$ we say that 
%$E'$ is a minimal Alternating Sub-LTS for $E$
%if $I'$ is not realizable then the following holds:
%\[
%\begin{matrix}
%\forall E'' \text{s.t. } E'' \text{ is a closest Alternating Sub-LTS for } E'\\
%\implies\\
%\mathcal{I}''=<E'', \mathcal{C}, \varphi> \text{ is realizable}\\
%\end{matrix}
%\]
%
%\end{definition}
%
%This definition (\ref{def:minimal-non realizability legal-plant}) encapsulates 
%what we expect from $min(\mathcal{I})$, i.e., if 
%$min(\mathcal{I})= \mathcal{I}'$, 
%$\mathcal{I}'=<E', \mathcal{C}, \varphi>$ then
%$E'$ should be a minimal Alternating Sub-LTS for $E$.

%The minization algorithm described below yields
%one minimal $E'$ Alternating Sub-LTS
%for $E$ and $\mathcal{C}$.
%First we remove all controllable transitions from mixed states since this
%is exactly what the realizability check does before computing the winning region
 
%then
%non controllable transitions are progressively removed from the automaton under
%minimization (this is what we call $\mathcal{T}_u$ or candidate set),
%the closest Alternating Sub-LTS is computed from the resulting partial structure 
%and a one step back track is fired every time a realizable Alternating Sub-LTS is found.
% A minimal Alternating Sub-LTS is found when no further reduction is available.

%By way of contradiction, if $\mathcal{I}_1$ is realizable but
%$\mathcal{I}_2$ is not, then the strategy for the environment
%on $E_2$ should not hold on $E_1$.  But since we know that
%$E_2 \sublts E_1$, this does not hold as a consequence of lemma ~\ref{theorem:theo.preserves-non-realizability}, hence proving the 
%contradiction.

%\input{Proof_LTS_Preserves_Realizability}

The minimization algorithm is
presented in figure \ref{fig:dfs-code}, it starts by removing all controllable transitions from
mixed states \listRef{A}, this can be thought as the successive removals of controllable 
transitions. This step satisfies the Alternating Sub-LTS definition 
and preserves unrealizability because, if the specification was unrealizable
when preserving the mixed state, it will remain unrealizable when the controllable transitions are removed.  This is justified by the fact that, when the execution reaches a mixed state, the environment
is assumed to always pick the next move before the system.
The next step of the algorithm initializes the set of 
candidate transitions
for removal at \listRef{B} and the effective list
to be removed at each iteration (\texttt{to\_remove}) at
\listRef{C}.  The latter keeps track of the transitions
removed along our search down the space of
Alternating Sub-LTSs that starts at $E$.  The exploration
will continue until the candidate set is empty.
At each cycle starting at \listRef{D} the set is updated, \listRef{E}, by 
removing those transitions that were already taken out by the reduction
at \listRef{F} or because they would induce a deadlock. Condition 
$d_{out}(E', t.from) == 1$ checks if there is only one
outgoing transition in the state from which \textbf{t} originates.
The
reduction at \listRef{F} looks for the closest
Alternating Sub-LTS obtained after removing 
transitions in \texttt{to\_remove} from $E$.
Then it checks for realizability at \listRef{G}.  If the control problem is 
unrealizable the candidate set and the last 
Alternating Sub-LTS $E'$ are updated (since further minimization is 
possible), otherwise a one step backtrack
is triggered by removing the transition under test from
the effective set \texttt{to\_remove} at \listRef{H}.
This is actually the backtracking point where the algorithm
redirects the search sideways in the semi-lattice instead of downwards.
Once the candidate set has been completely explored
the last unrealizability preserving LTS $E'$ is
returned as a minimal Alternating Sub-LTS
for $E$ and $\mathcal{C}$ at \listRef{I}.
Notice that
at \listRef{H} the transition $t$ was removed
from the candidate set but was retained in $E'$.  What happens if
the transition could have been removed further down the semi lattice?  Removing $t$ from $E'$ and reducing the Alternating Sub-LTS 
$E_{new}$ accordingly would render the control problem realizable.  Suppose that
the search continued preserving $t$ and removing other candidates
$t_1, \ldots, t_n$ from $E'$ getting the Alternating Sub-LTS
$E_{1,\ldots,n}$ that still contains $t$ while preserving unrealizability.
If we were to remove $t$ from $E_{1,\ldots,n}$ after reducing it
to the closest Alternating Sub-LTS we would get a new LTS
$E'_{new}$ that can be Alternating Sub-LTS for $E_{new}$, and from lemma
\ref{def:induction-preserves} it will render the control problem
realizable.  This is the reason why, if we are looking for just one
unrealizability cause, the transition that yielded realizability can be immediately removed 
from the candidate set without jeopardizing minimality.
%\input{optimizations}


We introduced two modifications to the algorithm
to improve the time it takes to compute the minimization.
The first optimization transforms the candidate set $\mathcal{T}_u$
into a list and orders it according to the distance of its elements 
with respect to the initial state.  The idea is to try and cut
as aggressively as possible, and see if an early cut still
preserves the unrealizability cause.  The second optimization
looks for non controllable strips within the  input automaton
$E$, that is, sequences of non controllable actions without branches.
For each of these sequences only one action is
added to $\mathcal{T}_u$ since, if removed from $E'$
when looking for a minimal sub LTS all the others have to be removed
as well to preserve alternation.

The second procedure follows a similar approach but uses the Delta Debugging technique presented in ~\cite{DBLP:journals/tse/ZellerH02} to improve the search space exploration. Instead of reducing the automaton by applying an atomic reduction at a time, Delta Debugging tries to achieve a minimal diagnosis by partitioning the problem $\Delta$ into $n$ uniform subsets ($\Delta = \bigcup_{i=1}^n \Delta_i $). It checks its elements $\Delta_i$ for a unrealizable smaller case first and if none is found it proceeds by looking at the complement $\Delta \setminus \Delta_i$ of each element in the partition. If no smaller candidate was found it increases the granularity by updating $n$ as $max(2n,|\Delta|)$. This cycle is repeated until $n$ can not be increased any further ($n \geq |\Delta|$). 
In our application of Delta Debugging the set $\Delta$ is the set of non controllable transitions in the original plant. Instead of descending regularly down the semi lattice, Delta Debugging tries to jump further down by removing a subset of transitions from the current candidate. The application of the technique is justified by the fact that Delta Debugging ensures 1-minimality, i.e. that removing any single element from the resulting minimization breaks unrealizability, which in conjunction with lemma ~\ref{def:induction-preserves} implies minimality.
