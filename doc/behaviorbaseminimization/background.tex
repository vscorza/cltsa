\section{Preliminaries}


We model safety assumptions on the environment and goals for the system as composition of Labelled Transition Systems (LTS). 
\begin{definition}
	\label{def:LTS} \emph{(Labelled Transition Systems)} 
	A \emph{Labelled Transition System} (LTS) is $E =  (S, \Sigma, \Delta, s_0)$, where $S$ is a finite set of states, $\Sigma \subseteq Act$ is its {\em communicating alphabet}, $\Delta \subseteq (S \times \Sigma \times S)$ is a transition relation, and $s_0 \in S$ is the initial state.  We denote $\Delta(s)=\set{\act~|~(s,\act,s') \in \Delta}$. 
	An LTS is deterministic if $(s,\act,s')$ and $(s,\act,s'')$ are in $\Delta$ implies $s'=s''$.
	An execution of $E$ is a word $\varepsilon=s_0, \act_0, s_1, \ldots$ where $(s_i, \act_i, s_{i+1}) \in \Delta$. 
	A word $\pi$ is a trace (induced by $\varepsilon$) of $E$ if its the result of removing every $s_i$ from an execution $\varepsilon$ of $E$. 
	We denote the set of infinite traces of $E$ by $\traces(E)$. 
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}\label{def:parallelComposition}\emph{(Parallel Composition)}
	Let $P=(S_P,\Sigma_P,\Delta_P,s_{0_P})$ y $Q=(S_Q,\Sigma_Q,\Delta_Q,s_{0_Q})$ be two LTSs, then 
	the parallel composition $P\|Q$ is defined as $P \| Q = (S_P \times S_Q, \Sigma_P \cup \Sigma_Q, \Delta_{P\|Q}, (s_{0_P}, s_{0_Q}))$
	where $\Delta_{P\|Q}$ is the smallest relation satisfying that for all $s, t \in S_P$, $s',t' \in S_Q$ and $\ell \in \Sigma_P \cup \Sigma_Q$:
	\small
	\begin{gather*}
	(s,\ell,t) \in \Delta_{P} \wedge a \not\in \Sigma_Q \Rightarrow ((s,s'),\ell,(t,s')) \in \Delta_{P\|Q}\\
	(s',\ell,t') \in \Delta_{Q} \wedge \ell \not\in \Sigma_P \Rightarrow ((s,s'),\ell,(s,t')) \in \Delta_{P\|Q}\\
	(s,\ell,t) \in \Delta_{P} \wedge (s',\ell,t') \in \Delta_{Q} \Rightarrow ((s,s'),\ell,(t,t')) \in \Delta_{P\|Q} 
	\end{gather*}
	\normalsize
\end{definition}

The distinction between what an LTS can control and what it can monitor is enforced through the notion of 
{\em legal environment} taken from~\cite{DIppolito:2013}, and inspired in that of Interface Automata ~\cite{DBLP:conf/sigsoft/AlfaroH01}.
Intuitively, a controller does not block the actions that it does not control, and dually, the environment does not restrict controllable actions. 

\begin{definition} \label{def:IALTS} \emph{(Legal LTS)}
	Given LTSs $C = (S_C, \Sigma_C$, $\Delta_C$, $s_{0_C})$ and $E = (S_E,\Sigma_E,\Delta_E,s_{0_E})$, where $\Sigma$ is partitioned into actions controlled and monitored (non controllable) by $C$ ($\Sigma=\mathcal{C} \; \cup \;\mathcal{U}$), we say that $C$ is a legal LTS for $E$ if for all $(s_E,s_C) \in E\|C$ it holds that
	$\Delta_{E}(s_E)\cap \mathcal{C} \supseteq \Delta_{C}(s_C)\cap \mathcal{C}$ and also that  $\Delta_{E}(s_E)\cap \mathcal{U} \subseteq \Delta_{C}(s_C)\cap \mathcal{U}$.
	
\end{definition}

%We use $\Delta(s)$ to denote the set $\{\ell~|~(s,\ell,s') \in 
%\Delta \}$ and $\Delta(s,\ell)=\set{s'~|~(s,\ell,s')\in\ \Delta_E}$.
%We say that an LTKS is deterministic if, whenever $(s,\ell,s')$ and 
%$(s,\ell,s'')$ are in $\Delta$, $s'=s''$. 
%We use $\initialState{E}$ and $\states{E}$ to refer to $S_0$ and $S$ respectively.
%For deterministic LTKS, we also use $E\executes(a)$ to denote the LTKS $(S, A, P, \Delta, v, s)$ if $(s_0, a, s) \in \Delta$, and $E$ otherwise.
%\end{definition}
%\begin{definition}\emph{(Traces)}
%A trace of $E$ is $\pi\!=\!s_0,\ell_0,s_1,\ell_1,\cdots$, where $s_0$ is an initial state of $E$ and, for every $i\geq 
%0$, we have $(s_i,\ell_i,s_{i+1})\in \Delta$.
% We denote as $\pi|_{\Sigma}$ the 
%sequence that is the result of removing from $\pi$ all actions not in
%$\Sigma$. 
%We denote the set of infinite traces of $E$ by $\traces(E)$. 
%We will assume systems yield infinite traces. 
%\end{definition}

%\begin{definition}\emph{(Traces)}


%We describe liveness goals and assumptions using fluent linear temporal \gr formulae. Linear
%temporal logics (LTL) are widely used to describe behaviour requirements~\cite{CITA INCORRECTA: DBLP:conf/sigsoft/GiannakopoulouM03}.
%The motivation for
We use linear temporal logics on fluents (FLTL) since they provide a uniform framework
for specifying state-based temporal properties in event-based models~\cite{DBLP:conf/sigsoft/GiannakopoulouM03}. 
A \emph{fluent} \fluent is defined by a pair of sets and a Boolean value: $\emph{\fluent} = \langle I_{\emph{\fluent}}, T_{\emph{\fluent}}, \emph{Init}_{\emph{\fluent}} \rangle$, where $I_{\emph{\fluent}}\subseteq Act$ is the set of initiating actions, $T_{\emph{\fluent}}\subseteq Act$ is the set of terminating actions and $I_{\emph{\fluent}}\cap T_{\emph{\fluent}}=\emptyset$. 
A fluent may be initially \true or \false as indicated by \emph{Init}$_{\emph{\fluent}}$. 
Every action $\ell\in Act$ induces a fluent, namely $\fluentp{\ell}=\langle \ell, Act\setminus \set{\ell}, \false\rangle$. 
Finally, the alphabet of a fluent is the union of its terminating and initiating actions.

Let $\mathcal{F}$ be the set of all possible fluents over $Act$. 
An FLTL formula is defined inductively using the standard Boolean connectives and temporal operators $\bigcirc$~(next), $U$ (strong until) as follows: 
$\varphi ::= \fluent \mid \neg \varphi \mid \varphi \vee \psi \mid \X \varphi \mid \varphi U \psi,$
where $\fluent\in\mathcal{F}$. 
As usual we introduce $\wedge$, $\Diamond$ (eventually), and $\square$ (always) as syntactic sugar. 
Let $\Pi$ be the set of infinite traces over \emph{Act}.
The trace $\pi=\ell_0,\ell_1,\ldots$ satisfies a fluent $\emph{Fl}$ at position $i$, denoted $\pi,i \models \emph{Fl}$, if and only if at least one of the following conditions holds:
%\begin{list}{-} %{\leftmargin=3em}
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\emph{Init}_{\emph{Fl}} \wedge (\forall j \in \mathbb{N} \cdot 0 \leq j \leq i \rightarrow \ell_j \notin T_{\fluent})$
	\item $\exists j \in \mathbb{N} \cdot (j \leq i \wedge \ell_j \in I_{\fluent}) \wedge (\forall k \in \mathbb{N} \cdot j < k \leq i \ \rightarrow \ell_k \notin T_{\fluent})$
	%\end{list}
\end{itemize}

We will assume that FLTL formulae are equipped with the corresponding
fluent definition triples.
Formula satisfaction for FLTL is defined as follows: 
given an infinite trace $\pi$, the satisfaction of a formula $\varphi$ at position $i$, denoted $\pi,i\models\varphi$, is defined as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:back:satisfactionop}.  
\begin{figure}[bt]
	$$\begin{array}{lcl}
	\pi,i \models \fluent &\triangleq & \pi,i \models \fluent  \\
	\pi,i \models \neg \varphi & \triangleq & \neg(\pi,i \models \varphi) \\
	\pi,i \models \varphi \vee \psi &\triangleq& (\pi,i\models \varphi) \vee (\pi,i models \psi) \\
	\pi,i \models \bigcirc \varphi &\triangleq & \pi,1 \models \varphi \\
	\pi,i \models \varphi \bf U \psi &\triangleq&\exists j \geq i \cdot \pi,j \models \psi \wedge \forall \mbox{ }i \leq k < j \cdot \pi,k \models \varphi\\
	\end{array}$$
	\caption{Semantics for the satisfaction operator}
	\label{fig:back:satisfactionop}
	\vspace{-1em}
\end{figure}


We say that $\varphi$ holds in $\pi$, denoted $\pi\models\varphi$, if $\pi,0\models\varphi$. 
A formula $\varphi \in \mbox{FLTL}$ holds in an LTS $E$ (denoted $E \models \varphi$) if it holds on every infinite trace produced by $E$.

In this paper we restrict attention to \gr~\cite{DBLP:journals/jcss/BloemJPPS12} formulas as there are effective synthesis algorithms for this sub-logic~\cite{DBLP:journals/jcss/BloemJPPS12}. \gr formulae are of the form $\varphi = \bigwedge_{i=1}^n \square\Diamond \assume_i \implies \bigwedge_{j=1}^m \square\Diamond \guarantee_j$, where $\{\assume_1 \ldots \assume_n\}$ and $\{\guarantee_1 \ldots \guarantee_m\}$ are propositional FLTL formulae.

%%%represent the set of
%%%assumptions that should
%%%always eventually be satisfied in order to 
%%%always eventually satisfy the set of goals
%%%$\{\guarantee_1 \ldots \guarantee_m\}$.
%%%\gr is an expressive subset that has gained increased interest recently due to the development of tractable synthesis algorithms for it~\cite{DBLP:journals/jcss/BloemJPPS12}.

%From the FLTL definition it follows that many results for LTL can be
%easily extended to FLTL.

We now provide a standard definition of parallel composition of LTSs to support compositional construction of environment models~\cite{DBLP:journals/cacm/Hoare78}.
% which is defined as an LTS that models the asynchronous execution of composed models, interleaving non-shared actions but forcing synchronisation on shared actions.

We now formally define the control problem for \gr formulas.


\begin{definition}\label{def:lts-control}\emph{(LTS \gr Control)}
	Given a specification for a problem domain in the form of an environment LTS $E =  (S, \Sigma, \Delta, s_0)$, a set of controllable actions $\mathcal{C}$, and a \gr formula  $\varphi$, the solution for the LTS control problem $\mathcal{I}=\langle E, \mathcal{C}, \varphi\rangle$ is to find an LTS $M$ such that $M$ is a legal LTS for $E$ ,
	$E\|M$ is deadlock free, and $M\|E \models \varphi$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\label{def:state-characterization}\emph{((Non) Controllable and Mixed States)}
	Given an LTS $E =  (S, \Sigma, \Delta, s_0)$, a set of controllable actions $\mathcal{C} \subseteq \Sigma$ and its complement $\mathcal{U} = \Sigma \setminus \mathcal{C}$,  a state $s \in S$ is called controllable if $\Delta(s) \cap \mathcal{C} = \Delta(s)$, non controllable if $\Delta(s) \cap \mathcal{U} \neq \emptyset$ and mixed otherwise.  We will refer to non mixed states pure states.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\label{def:twoplayer-game}\emph{(Two-player Game)}
	A two player game $G$ is defined as the tuple $G=(S_g,\Gamma^{-},\Gamma^{+},s_{g0}, \varphi)$ where $S_{g}$ is a finite set of states, $\Gamma^{-}$,$\Gamma^{+}$ $\subseteq S\times S$ are transition relations defined for the uncontrollable and controllable transtiions respectively, $s_{g0}\in S_{g}$ is the initial condition and $\varphi \subseteq S_{g}^{\omega}$ is the winning condition.  We denote $\Gamma^{-}(s) =$ $\{s'|(s,s')$ $\in \Gamma^{-}\}$ and in a similar fashion for $\Gamma^{+}(s)$. A state $s$ is uncontrollable if $\Gamma^{-}(s)\neq \emptyset$ and controllable otherwise.  A play on $G$ is a sequence $p=s_0,s_1,\ldots$ an a play $p$ ending in $s_{g_{n}}$ is extended by the controller choosing a subset $\gamma \subseteq \Gamma^{+}(s_{g_{n}})$.  Then the environment chooses a state $s_{g_{n+1}}$ $\in \gamma \cup \Gamma^{-}(s_{g_{n}})$ and adds $s_{g_{n+1}}$ to $p$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\label{def:strategy}\emph{((Counter)Strategy with memory)}
	A strategy with memory $\Omega$ for the controller is a pair of functions $(\delta, u)$ where $\Omega$ is some memory domain, $\delta:\Omega\times S \rightarrow 2^{S}$ such that $\delta(\omega, s) \subseteq \Gamma^{+}(s)$ and $u:\Omega \times S \rightarrow \Omega$.
	A counter strategy with memory $\nabla$ for the environment is a pair of functions $(\kappa, v)$ where $\nabla$ is some memory domain, $\kappa:\nabla\times S \rightarrow 2^{S}$ such that $\kappa(\nabla, s) \subseteq \Gamma^{-}(s)$ and $v:\nabla \times S \rightarrow \nabla$.
\end{definition}


%\begin{definition}\label{def:consistency}\emph{(Consistency under (Non)Controllability and Winning (Counter)Strategy)}
%	A finite or infinite play $p= s_0,s_1,\ldots$ is consistent under controllability if for every $n$ we have $s_{n+1} \in \delta(\omega_n,s_n)$, where $\omega_{i+1}=u(\omega_i,s_{i+1})$ for all
%	$i \geq 0$. A strategy $(\delta, u)$ for controller from state $s$ is 
%	winning if every maximal play starting in $s$ and consistent under controllability with $(\delta, u)$ is infinite and remains within $\varphi$.  We say that the controller wins the game $G$ if it has a winning strategy from the initial state. For the non controllable case,
%	a finite or infinite play $p= s_0,s_1,\ldots$ is consistent under non-controllability if for every $n$ we have $s_{n+1} \in \kappa(\nabla_n,s_n)$, where $\nabla_{i+1}=v(\nabla_i,s_{i+1})$ for all
%	$i \geq 0$. A strategy $(\kappa, v)$ for environment from state $s$ is 
%	winning if every maximal play starting in $s$ and consistent under non-controllability with $(\kappa, v)$ is infinite and exits $\varphi$ at some point.  We say that the environment wins the game $G$ if it has a winning strategy from the initial state.
%\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\label{def:generalized-reactivity}\emph{(Generalized Reactivity(1))}
	Given an infinite sequence of states $p$, let $inf(p)$ denote the states that occur infinitely often in $p$, let $\phi_1,\ldots,\phi_n$ and $\gamma_1,\ldots,\gamma_m$ be subsets of $S$.  Let $gr((\phi_1,\ldots,\phi_n),(\gamma_1,\ldots,\gamma_m))$ denote the set of infinite sequences $p$ such that either for some $i$ we have $inf(p) \cap \phi_i = \emptyset$ or for all $j$ we have $inf(p)\cap \gamma_j \neq \emptyset$. A GR(1) game is a game where the winning condition $\varphi$ is $gr((\phi_1,\ldots,\phi_n),(\gamma_1,\ldots,\gamma_m))$.
\end{definition}


%\begin{definition}\label{def:counter-strategy}\emph{(Counter-strategy with memory)}
%A counter strategy with memory $\nabla$ for the environment is a pair of functions $(\kappa, v)$ where $\nabla$ is some memory domain with designate start value $\nabla_{0}$, $\kappa:\nabla\times S \rightarrow 2^{S}$ such that $\kappa(\nabla, s) \subseteq \Gamma^{-}(s)$ and $v:\nabla \times S \rightarrow \nabla$.
%\end{definition}
%
%\begin{definition}\label{def:counter-consistency}\emph{(Consistency under Non-Controllability and Winning Strategy for the Environment)}
%A finite or infinite play $p= s_0,s_1,\ldots$ is consistent under non-controllability if for every $n$ we have $s_{n+1} \in \kappa(\nabla_n,s_n)$, where $\nabla_{i+1}=v(\nabla_i,s_{i+1})$ for all
%$i \geq 0$. A strategy $(\kappa, v)$ for environment from state $s$ is 
%winning if every maximal play starting in $s$ and consistent under non-controllability with $(\kappa, v)$ is infinite and remains exits $\varphi$ at least at some point.  We say that the environment wins the game $G$ if it has a winning strategy from the initial state.
%\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\label{def:lts-2-game}\emph{(($G_{\mathcal{I}}$) Two-Player Game for $\mathcal{I}$ )}
	We convert the GR(1) LTS control problem $\mathcal{I}=\langle E, \mathcal{C}, \varphi \rangle$ to a two-player GR(1) game $G (\mathcal{I})=(S_{g},\Gamma{-},\Gamma{+},s_{g0},\varphi)$ as follows: every state in $S_{g}$ encodes a state in $E$ and a valuation of all fluents
	appearing in $\varphi$. We build $S_g$ from $E$ in such a way that states in the game encode a state in $E$ and truth values for all fluents in $\varphi$, let $S_g = S_e \times \Pi_{i=0}^{k}\{true,false\}$.  Consider state $s_g=(s_e,\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_k)$, given fluent $fl_i$ we say that $s_g$ satisfies $fl_i$ if and only if $\alpha_i$ is $true$. We generalize satisfaction to boolean combination of fluents in the natural way.  We build the transition relations $\Gamma^{-}$,$\Gamma^{+}$ through the following rules.  Consider state $s_g=(s_e,\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_k)$, for every transition $(s_e,l,s'_e) \in \Delta$ we include $(s_g,(s'_e,\alpha'_1,\ldots,\alpha'_k))$ in $\Gamma^{\beta}$ where
	$\beta$ is $+$ if $l \in \mathcal{C}$ and in $\Gamma^{-}$ otherwise.
	$\alpha'_i$ is $\alpha_i$ if $l \neg\in I_{fl_i} \cup T_{fl_i}$, $\alpha'_i$ is $true$ if $l \in I_{fl_i}$ and $false$ if $l \in T_{fl_i}$.  
	If $s_e$ is a mixed state (i.e., $\Delta(s_e) \cap \mathcal{C} \neq \emptyset$
	$\wedge$
	$\Delta(s_e) \cap \mathcal{U} \neq \emptyset$) we only include
	$(s_g, (s'_e,\alpha'_1,\ldots,\alpha'_k))$ in $\Gamma^{-}$
	if $l \in \mathcal{U}$ since we will consider mixed states as 
	non-controllable (antagonistic) in the game.
	$s_{g0}$ is $(s_0, Init_{fl_1},\ldots, Init_{fl_k})$.
	Let $\varphi_g \subseteq S_g^{\omega}$ be the set of sequences that satisfy $gr((\phi_1,\ldots,\phi_n),(\gamma_1,\ldots,\gamma_m))$.
\end{definition}

%Although the synthesis problem for general FLTL goals is 2EXPTIME
%complete~\cite{DBLP:conf/popl/PnueliR89}. Nevertheless, restrictions on the form of
%the goal and assumptions specification have been studied and found
%to be solvable in polynomial time. The formulation above, which is restricted to \gr, has a polinomial solution~\cite{DBLP:conf/vmcai/PitermanPS06}. An adaptation of \gr in the context
%of LTS has been presented in~\cite{DBLP:conf/sigsoft/DIppolitoBPU10} 


%
%DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDd NADA DE ACA PARA ABAJO. CREO
%
%Starting with \cite{church1962logic} the synthesis problem is presented
%as a correct by construction, automated way of producing the expected system.
%A linear temporal logic specification solution was proposed in 
%\cite{DBLP:conf/popl/PnueliR89} and a computational efficient 
%approach developed in \cite{DBLP:journals/jcss/BloemJPPS12}.
%This  set of techniques expand the domain of non realizability diagnosis
%beyond model checking for manually written specification .
%It is only reasonable to shed some light on the causes of non realizability
%if our initial claim was that engineers will be relieved from the
%eternal cycle of suffering a specification through manual trial and error.
%Otherwise we would be exchanging the problem of hopefully
%progressive model checking with the one of hopefully progressive
%realizability checking.
%% (A)
%In the context of the present work we put the focus on non realizability.
%
%In such scenarios, when there is no way
%to build a system that satisfies $\varphi$, it is insightful
%to turn the table and look at
%the realizability game from the other side of
%the board.  Instead of reasoning about the satisfaction
%of the formula, we look at the way the environment
%falsifies it by picking a winning move for
%every choice available to the system at every step. 
%In this work we focus on simplifying the understanding of
%this kind of problem.\\
%If we think in game theoretical terms we could be tempted
%to assume that we are providing an explicit representation
%of the counter strategy, when in reality we are providing
%a subset of the explicit behavior of the plant that allows
%a minimal counter strategy to be enacted.

%\begin{definition}
%\label{def:game} \emph{(Two-player Game)} A \emph{Two-player}
%\emph{Ga\-me} (Game) is
%$G=(S_g,\Gamma^{-},\Gamma^{+},s_{g_0},\varphi)$, where $S_g$ is a
%finite set of states, $\Gamma^{-},\Gamma^{+}\subseteq S_g\times S_g$
%are transition relations, $s_{g_0}\in S_g$ is the initial state, and
%$\varphi\subseteq S_g^\omega$ is a winning condition. We denote
%$\Gamma^{-}(s_g) = \{s_g' ~|~ (s_g,s_g') \in \Gamma^{-}\}$ and
%similarly for $\Gamma^{+}$. A state $s_g$ is \emph{uncontrollable}
%if $\Gamma^{-}(s_g)\neq \emptyset$ and \emph{controllable}
%otherwise. A \emph{play} on $G$ is a sequence
%$p=s_{g_0},s_{g_1},\ldots$. A play $p$ ending in $s_{g_n}$ is
%extended by the controller choosing a subset $\gamma \subseteq
%\Gamma^{+}(s_{g_n})$. Then, the environment chooses a state
%$s_{g_{n+1}} \in \gamma \cup \Gamma^{-}(s_{g_{n+1}})$ and adds
%$s_{g_{n+1}}$ to $p$.
%
%A \emph{strategy with memory $\Omega$} for the controller is a pair
